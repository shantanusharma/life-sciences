**Supported pipelines:**
- **rnaseq**: Gene expression and differential expression analysis
- **sarek**: Germline and somatic variant calling (WGS/WES)
- **atacseq**: Chromatin accessibility analysis

**Features:**
- Download public datasets from GEO/SRA
- Auto-detect data types and suggest appropriate pipelines
- Generate pipeline-compatible samplesheets
- Environment validation and troubleshooting guidance

**Requirements**: Docker and Nextflow installed locally

#### scvi-tools
**Plugin ID**: `scvi-tools@life-sciences`

Deep learning toolkit for single-cell omics analysis using scvi-tools. Includes model selection guidance, training workflows, and integration pipelines for scVI, scANVI, totalVI, PeakVI, MultiVI, and more.

## Authentication Requirements

- **No authentication**: PubMed
- **Free account required**: BioRender, Synapse, Wiley Scholar Gateway
- **Paid/institutional account**: 10x Genomics (requires data in account to be useful)

## Support

For issues with:
- **Claude Code plugin system**: Report in #claude-cli-feedback on Anthropic Slack
- **Individual MCP servers**: Contact the respective provider's support

## License

Individual MCP servers are licensed by their respective providers. See each provider's terms of service for details.

## Removed Plugins

- **Benchling**: Removed because Benchling uses tenant-specific URLs which are not supported by the plugin system.
